\section{\sc Professional Experience}
%%%%%%
{\bf UC Santa Cruz Computer Vision Lab}, Santa Cruz, CA.  \hfill{December 2016 -- Present}\\
\tab[4mm]{\em Software Research Assistant}\hfill 
\begin{itemize} %Job Description%
	\item Developed an Android application that is used to test and compare the inference speed of TensorFlow Lite models on mobile devices
	\item  Studied the costs and benefits of on-board vs. server side inference for mobile Convolutional Neural Networks
	\item 	Responsible for the development of an Android application to be used by the visually impaired to identify text in their surroundings. Application streams image data from the phone's camera to a Linux server which returns the location and characters of text found in the Android camera's capture range.
\end{itemize}
